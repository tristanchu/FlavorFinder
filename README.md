# FlavorFinder
The app for finding and saving your new favorite flavor combinations. Created for CS 98 Senior Project Implementation at Dartmouth College.

Project by: Courtney Ligh, Jaki Kimball, Tristan Chu, and Jon

## Pitch
The Flavor Finder is a flavor pairing lookup mobile app—a creative culinary tool for inspiration, experimentation, and reference with user-generated content. There is currently no easy mobile way to look up what flavors go well together or what flavors go well with the ingredients you currently have (except for wine+cheese pairing apps that don’t cover the scope of flavors we hope to cover). A book called [The Flavor Bible](http://www.amazon.com/The-Flavor-Bible-Creativity-Imaginative/dp/0316118400) exists with a flavor lookup section, but it is bulky and its eBook is not user-friendly; moreover, it is incomplete in certain respects. This app will be perfect for looking up flavors on the go (e.g. supermarket, farmer's market), but also handy in the kitchen

**Target users:** experienced and experimental cooks (intermediate to advanced skill)

Advanced features beyond basic flavor lookup:

1. **advanced searches** (e.g. filter out non-vegetarian flavors, search for flavors compatible with two or three user-chosen flavors rather than just one, etc.)
	
2. **multi-item searches** (e.g. look up what goes with carrots *and* peas!

3. **favorites** (pin favored ingredients to the top of your search results)

4. **lists** (keep track of ingredient groups through our lists feature)

## Strategy & Timeline
This winter term we plan on focusing heavily on UI/UX. 

* **Week One** - UI/UX Redesign and Re-Scoping
* **Week Two** - Refactor and Multi-search
* **Week Three** - Dev Testing Report
* **Week Four** - Add in List and Favs
* **Week Five** - Midterm Demo - have app ready
* **Week Six** - User Test and Study time
* **Week Seven** - Incorporate User Study Findings
* **Week Eight** - App Cleanup
* **Week Nine** - Final Presentations
* **Week Ten** - Public Demo

## Implementation
Flavor Finder is an iOS app built using Swift in Xcode. We use Github for version control and file sharing among the group members. For our initial test data, we will use a small portion of The Flavor Bible book as a model set. Ideally, we will move into having a community-driven data set, but the Flavor Bible works as a strictly educational source as it closely models the type of data and relations that we want to capture, convey, and query.

## Frameworks Used
* [**Parse**](https://www.parse.com/?) as a backend solution.
* [**Cocoapods**](https://cocoapods.org/) for package management.
* [**icons8**](https://icons8.com/), [**Font Awesome**](http://fontawesome.io), [**The Noun Project**](https://thenounproject.com/) for icons.
* [**Toast-Swift**](https://github.com/scalessec/Toast-Swift) for Toast notifications as user action feedback.
